<doc f='include/llvm-7/llvm/Pass.h' l='148'>/// releaseMemory() - This member can be implemented by a pass if it wants to
  /// be able to release its memory when it is no longer needed.  The default
  /// behavior of passes is to hold onto memory for the entire duration of their
  /// lifetime (which is the entire compile time).  For pipelined passes, this
  /// is not a big deal because that memory gets recycled every time the pass is
  /// invoked on another program unit.  For IP passes, it is more important to
  /// free memory when it is unused.
  ///
  /// Optionally implement this function to release pass memory when it is no
  /// longer used.</doc>
