<doc f='include/llvm-7/llvm/ADT/Hashing.h' l='591'>/// Combine values into a single hash_code.
///
/// This routine accepts a varying number of arguments of any type. It will
/// attempt to combine them into a single hash_code. For user-defined types it
/// attempts to call a \see hash_value overload (via ADL) for the type. For
/// integer and pointer types it directly combines their data into the
/// resulting hash_code.
///
/// The result is suitable for returning from a user&apos;s hash_value
/// *implementation* for their user-defined type. Consumers of a type should
/// *not* call this routine, they should instead call &apos;hash_value&apos;.</doc>
