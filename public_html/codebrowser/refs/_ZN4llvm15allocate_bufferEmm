<doc f='include/llvm-7/llvm/Support/Compiler.h' l='511'>/// Allocate a buffer of memory with the given size and alignment.
///
/// When the compiler supports aligned operator new, this will use it to to
/// handle even over-aligned allocations.
///
/// However, this doesn&apos;t make any attempt to leverage the fancier techniques
/// like posix_memalign due to portability. It is mostly intended to allow
/// compatibility with platforms that, after aligned allocation was added, use
/// reduced default alignment.</doc>
