<doc f='include/math.h' l='611'>/* In C++ mode, __MATH_TG cannot be used, because it relies on
     __builtin_types_compatible_p, which is a C-only builtin.
     The check for __cplusplus allows the use of the builtin instead of
     __MATH_TG. This is provided for libstdc++, only to let its configure
     test work. No further use of this definition of signbit is expected
     in C++ mode, since libstdc++ provides its own version of signbit
     in cmath (which undefines signbit). */</doc>
