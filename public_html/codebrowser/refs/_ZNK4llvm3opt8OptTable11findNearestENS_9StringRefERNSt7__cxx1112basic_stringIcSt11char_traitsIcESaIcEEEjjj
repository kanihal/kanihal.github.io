  /// \param [in] Option - A string, such as &quot;-stdlibs=l&quot;, that represents user

  /// \param [out] NearestString - The nearest option string found in the

  /// \param [in] FlagsToInclude - Only find options with any of these flags.
  /// Zero is the default, which includes all flags.
  /// \param [in] FlagsToExclude - Don&apos;t find options with this flag. Zero
  /// is the default, and means exclude nothing.
  /// \param [in] MinimumLength - Don&apos;t find options shorter than this length.
  /// For example, a minimum length of 3 prevents &quot;-x&quot; from being considered
